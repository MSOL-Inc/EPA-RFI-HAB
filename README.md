# EPA-RFI-HAB

Description:The code on this GitHub reporsitory is created in response to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Request for Information (RFI) to demonstrate Macro Solutions practices to provide digital services. Macro Solutions has proviedes digital servervice capabilities to its existing clients in the areas of agile software development, agile architecture, modular development, test-driven development, and DevOps. 

This README file outlines the objective of the small project that Macro Solutions built following agile Scrum sprints to demonstrate the agile software development practice. Given the short duration of the response Macro solutions selected to work on an application idea from EPA's application showcase called Harmful Algal Bloom Reporting App (HABs). (Details available at http://developer.epa.gov/hab-challenge/)

Harmful algal blooms are a major environmental problem in all 50 states. Known as red tides, blue-green algae, or cyanobacteria, harmful algal blooms have severe impacts on human health, aquatic ecosystems, and the economy. The objective of HAB App is to develop an application that will make it convenient and accessible for citizen scientists to report sightings of HABs. The information submitted through the application can be used to display HAB trends in local waterways. Displaying these trends could help raise awareness and influence forecasting and preventive measures implemented by states to reduce impact of HABs on human health.

Code Considerations: In order to keep the scope of HAB's application contained such that it can be addressed over a single sprint cycle following decisions were made as part of backlog grooming:
1) Keep the form simple such that the main idea about the application is demonstrateble.
2) Solution is built around the web browser form but the same form should be usable over other form factors like tablets or smartphones. 
3) The form submission capability is contained on the client side only to minimize the application design, development and deployment complexitity 

The detailed approach on building this application are described in a separate document from this README file that is submitted along with the RFI response.

Code access and use steps:
1) The code is a set of HTML, CSS and JS files that can be accessed from the GitHub URL https://github.com/MSOL-Inc/EPA-RFI-HAB. Copy the GitGub URL and place it in the location field of your browser window. 
2) Towards the right hand side of this page, close to the center of the page, there is a "Download ZIP" button. Click this button and save the zip file on your destop.
3) Locate the zip file in the file explorer and right click it to extract all the content from the zip file.
4) Double click on the "BloomReportForm.html" file from the extracted set of files and launch it in a web browers to fill the Bloom form fields and report Algae Bloom.
